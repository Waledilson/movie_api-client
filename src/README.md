Martini Shot

Martini Shot is an app designed as a repository for a few of my favorite movies. Utilizing the MERN stack, users are able to create a profile, browse a selection of movies, find infomation about those movies such as the movie's description, genre and director. Once the profile is created, the user can create a list of their own favorite movies and update their user information.

The building process of the app included building the entire back-end with authentication and authorization that included JWTtoken, CORS and Passport.

To make this app I used the following:
Node.js
React
Bootstrap
Redux
Parcel
MongoDB
Axios
Heroku
Javascript
HTML
CSS
