Martini Shot

Martini Shot is an app designed as a repository for a few of my favorite movies. Utilizing the MERN stack, users are able to create a profile, browse a selection of movies, find infomation about those movies such as the movie's description, genre and director. Once the profile is created, the user can create a list of their own favorite movies and update their user information.

The building process of the app included building the entire back-end with authentication and authorization that included JWTtoken, CORS and Passport.

To make this app I used the following:<br>
Node.js<br>
React<br>
Bootstrap<br>
Redux<br>
Parcel<br>
MongoDB<br>
Axios<br>
Heroku<br>
Javascript<br>
HTML<br>
CSS
